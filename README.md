# Glyconnection
Glyconnection is an platform for glycoside design and analysis.
It automatically generates O-, N-, S-, and C-glycosidic variants, calculates
molecular descriptors, scores each variant, and recommends the optimal
glycosidic linkage with scientific justification.

## Features
- Automatic glycosidic bond generation (O / N / S / C)
- Descriptor-based scoring
- Comparative analysis of variants
- LLM-based scientific explanation
- Supabase integration
- Web interface (Streamlit / Gradio)

## Scientific Scope
- Glycoside chemistry
- Drug design
- Natural products
- ADMET-aware optimization
